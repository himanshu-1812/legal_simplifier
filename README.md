## ðŸ“‹ Overview

Many legal documentsâ€”rental agreements, contracts, terms of serviceâ€”are written in complicated, technical language. This makes them hard to understand, especially for non-lawyers.

**Legal Document Simplifier** solves that by:

- Extracting key clauses and responsibilities  
- Summarizing obligations and terms in plain English  
- Highlighting potential risks and financial commitments  

The goal is to empower people to understand what they are agreeing toâ€”without needing legal training.
